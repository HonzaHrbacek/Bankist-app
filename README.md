# Bankist-app

Simple online banking app created in the online course JS: From Zero to Expert created by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Some of the things I have learned during this project:

- Number of array and string methods (forEach, map, filter, reduce, ...)
- Basic manipulation with DOM elements
- Formating of numbers and dates using Intl API
